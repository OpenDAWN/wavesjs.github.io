# Zoomer module

> {%= description %}

This module is a simple zoom implementation that interacts with the internal zXoom behaviour of the `timeline`.  
The zoom values can be passed from any external source such as a slider or user interaction, this is just an implementation bases on vertical and horizontal dragging in a div.
